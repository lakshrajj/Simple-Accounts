REACT_APP_API_URL=http://143.110.181.185:5000/api

# Option 1: Update your .env file
# Create or edit the .env file in your React project root:


# Option 2: Modify the api.js file directly
# Replace the API_URL line with:

const API_URL = 'http://143.110.181.185:5000/api';

# Option 3: If your backend is actually running at the remote IP but has CORS issues:
# Add this to your backend server (Express example):

app.use(cors({
  origin: '*', // In production, restrict this to your actual frontend domain
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'x-auth-token']
}));

# Option 4: If your backend is on the same domain as your frontend
# Replace the API_URL line with a relative URL:

const API_URL = '/api';

# Option 5: If the server is correctly at 143.110.181.185 but is not responding
# Check if the server is running and accessible:
# - SSH into the server and verify the API is running
# - Check firewall settings (iptables, ufw) to ensure port 5000 is open
# - Verify any cloud provider security groups allow traffic on port 5000
